      <div class = "homegrid-item" style = "text-align: center;font-size: larger;">Hello! I'm a Computer Engineering student at Temple
       University. I've consistently made Dean's list and maintained a 3.99 GPA. I'm actively applying my skills in Python and C++
       and, I'm eager to contribute to transformative projects. Let's connect and explore opportunities!<br><br>
      
      In my personal life, I like to do projects with electrical engineering and software engineering, I've been playing guitar for 10 years, and I run a small business where I sell baked goods. My favorite project I've done so far is upcycling a treadmill into a web-controlled walk pad and the genres of music I like to play include Math Rock and Classical, but I'm honestly just happy when I get to play anything. I love baking everything from rustic three ingredient sourdough loafs to creating recipes for chocolate chip cookies. </div>
