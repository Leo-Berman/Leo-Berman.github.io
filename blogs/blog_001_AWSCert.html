      <p class="blogheader">What is the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate? </p>
      <p class="blogbody">
	Usually, the AWS (Amazon Web Service) Cloud Practitioner certification is a great way to let employers know that you’re able to set your mind to a task, and accomplish it. If you don’t know what the certificate is, the final examination contains information about Amazon’s Web Services. The focus of the exam is on the business, security, general workflow, and light technical details about networking and some of Amazon’s software services. If you decide to get the Cloud Practitioner certificate, you’ll end up learning a lot about Amazon, and a little bit about networking. For me, it was a really great learning experience, and if you are starting from the ground on what the cloud or networking is, I would recommend it. However, there is no replacement for getting on the ground and just working some of this stuff out while actually 
	doing it.

      <p class="blogheader">How did I study?</p>
      <p class="blogbody">
	For some background, I’m a Computer Engineering student at Temple University, and at the time of earning my certification, I was taking a class called Data and Computer Communication. Luckily for me, by passing the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, I’d receive an automatic A+. Unluckily for me, I wasn’t able to find any resources from Temple to help me prepare for the exam.
	<br><br>
	So I began… procrastinating. As long as I got the certificate done by the end of the semester, I passed. I blew off assignments and didn’t attend lectures. I mean, Bill Gates did it, and look how he turned out. As the end of the semester started to loom, I very quickly learned that I was not Bill Gates, and I began to *lightly* panic.
	<br><br>
	So I began… googling! Success, I had actually started applying myself to the AWS certificate, I was going to do it! I was gonna pass and not have to cram all of the assignments from class into a month and a half, and… Shit. There are not a lot of free tools to help me learn about this certificate. I already have to spend 100$ just to take the test, I’m not paying whatever Udemy is charging for their course. As good as I’m sure that it is, I can’t justify it when I’m already paying for a college education.

      <p class="blogbody" style="font-size:30pt;margin-bottom:0;">Here’s some important things to note:</p>
      <ul  class="blogbody" style="margin-left:50px;">
	
	<li class="blogbody" >The test costs 100$ every time you take it (And I’ll be damned if I have to pay more than once)</li>
	<li class="blogbody">There is a two week cooldown to fail</li>
	<li class="blogbody">I have about 6 weeks left in the semester</li>
	<li class="blogbody">I have used AWS S3 to launch a static html website</li>

	<li class="blogbody">Besides that, I know nothing about AWS</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="blogbody">So I scoured the internet for some good resources and what I found is at the bottom of this page!
	<br><br>
	It’s important to note, that these may not be up to date for when you’re taking the exam, and that I probably missed some of the resources that I used. The most important thing is to just build your general sense for AWS and hope that that will be enough. As a STEM tutor of multiple years, I feel qualified to tell you that what I did was <u>wrong</u>. Take your time when you’re studying these kinds of certificates, because it may help you feel prepared to end up at the *architect* level. Moreover, me scouring the internet for ways to learn took many hours, and was not worth it. If you hear good things about a current AWS course, it’s probably worth the money. <b>HOWEVER</b>, it is 100% possible to do this without spending the money, and you should use the obvious free tools to show yourself you are committed.
	<br><br>
	Luckily for me, this go around was a success story and I passed on the first try. Some general words of advice are, use as much of the time as you can because a lot of these questions are loose word association with what you know even if you don’t know the exact answer. What I did on the actual exam was write a number for each of the questions, and mark which ones I was confident about, which ones I was unsure about, and which ones I had no idea about. Then I went through, refined my answers, and voila, I got a passing score. It’s important to note, that someone’s ability to pass this AWS course isn’t necessarily reflective of their ability to play a solid role as your “networking guy”. There are a lot of really competent people that hate to memorize these multiple choice questions. Overall, I don’t think this was less work than just doing the class I avoided, but maybe I’ll write another blog post about how it impacted my ability to get a job in tech.

	That’s all from me,<br>
